        <p><pre>
 CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout 
 system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the 
 way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, 
 but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, 
 positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and 
 left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).
 Flexbox is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has different 
 use cases — and they actually work together quite well! Grid is the very first 
 CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our 
 way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.</pre></p>

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p><pre>
As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed 
support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android), 
Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet 
Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but 
it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. 
The time to build with grid is now! To get started 
you have to define a container element as a grid with 
display: grid, set the column and row sizes with 
grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place 
its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.
Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t 
matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super 
easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining 
the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging 
it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple 
lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules 
ever introduced.

        <h2>Important Terminology</h2>
        <pre>
Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology.
Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse
them with one another if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid 
specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t many of them.

    </div>
        <div class="side-content-left">
            <h2>Grid Container</h2>
            <p><pre>
The element on which display: grid is 
applied. It’s the direct parent of 
all the grid items. In this example 
container is the grid container.
            </pre></p>
        </div>
        <div class="side-content-right">
            <h2>Grid Item</h2>
            <p><pre>
The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the 
grid container. Here the item elements are 
grid items, but sub-item isn’t.
